# How to Delete Your Data in Social Media Scheduler

Social Media Scheduler does not create or store any user accounts. All login credentials (tokens) for third-party services (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) are stored only on your device.

To delete your data:

1. Uninstall the app from your device.
2. This will permanently erase all locally stored tokens and data.

No personal data is transmitted to or stored on any server by the app. (Everything is stored locally on your device.) Therefore, uninstalling the app will remove all your data without any additional steps.
