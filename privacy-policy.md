# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 2024_

Thank you for using our Social Media Scheduler app. Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains how your data is handled when you use our app.

## Data Storage

- **On-Device Storage:**  
    All your data, including scheduled posts, media, and authentication credentials, are stored **locally on your device**. We do not collect, store, or transmit your data to any company servers.

## Data Transfer

- **Meta Platforms (Threads, Instagram):**  
    When posting to Meta platforms, your data may be **temporarily uploaded to [https://tmpfiles.org](https://tmpfiles.org)**. This service stores your data for a maximum of **1 hour** before automatically deleting it.

- **Other Platforms (YouTube, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.):**  
    For all other supported platforms, your data is sent **directly from your device** to the respective platform. No third-party temporary storage is used.

## Authentication Credentials

- **Local Storage Only:**  
    All authentication credentials (such as API tokens or login information) are stored **only on your device**. We do not store or transmit your credentials to any cloud service or external server.

## Data Security

We recommend keeping your device secure and up to date to protect your data. Since all data is stored locally, your privacy depends on your device's security.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in this document.
